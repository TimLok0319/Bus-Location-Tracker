**Campus Bus GPS Tracker**

A smart tracking system that provides real-time bus location visibility for students and staff via a web dashboard, using ESP32, GPS module, and IoT integration.

‚úÖ Problem Statement

Students and staff often wait without knowing the exact location of campus buses, leading to wasted time and frustration. The lack of real-time visibility on bus positions reduces convenience and efficiency on campus.

‚úÖ Proposed Solution

This project solves the problem by providing:

-Real-time bus location tracking using ESP32 and GPS.

-Cloud-based data storage (API/Firebase) for accessibility.

-A web dashboard to display the current bus position on a map.

-Future features such as ETA predictions, notifications, and AI-based optimizations.

*Task Division
We had divided our project into four main component:
Hardware, FrontEnd, Database and Backend.

API Documentation for Live Bus Tracker

Database: Firebase Realtime Database
Database URL: https://bus-location-tracker-62f5e-default-rtdb.asia-southeast1.firebasedatabase.app/.json
---

JSON Data Structure

The bus location data is stored under the buses/bus_01 path with the following JSON format:
{
  "date": "05/09/2025",
  "latitude": 5.3364,
  "longitude": 100.3067,
  "time": "15:30:00"
}

ESP32 to Database (Data Transmission)

~Method: PATCH or PUT
~Endpoint: https://bus-location-tracker-62f5e-default-rtdb.asia-southeast1.firebasedatabase.app/buses/bus_01.json
~Request Body (JSON): The firmware should send a JSON payload that matches the structure above. 
 For example:
 {
  "latitude": 5.3364,
  "longitude": 100.3067,
  "date": "05/09/2025",
  "time": "15:30:00"
}

---

Web Dashboard to Database (Data Retrieval)

~The dashboard uses the Firebase JavaScript SDK.
~It listens for real-time updates on the buses/bus_01 database path.
~The code retrieves the latitude and longitude fields to display the bus's location on the map.

------------------------------------------------Front End-----------------------------------------------------

**Web Dashboard**
A simple frontend prototype that uses the Google Maps JavaScript API to simulate live bus tracking, ETA calculation, and routing between bus stops.

üìå Features
-Displays a bus marker that updates position every 3 seconds.
-Bus stops are marked on the map.
-The next stop name is shown in a card.
-The ETA to the next stop is calculated using Google Maps Directions API.
-Routes can include waypoints for more realistic paths.

üó∫Ô∏è How It Works
*index.html
Loads the map container and a card for bus info.
Connects to script.js and Google Maps API.

*script.js
Initializes the map with a bus marker and bus stop markers.
Calls updateBus() every 3 seconds.
Fetches the latest bus position (dummy JSON endpoint for now).
Updates the bus marker, redraws the route, and updates ETA in the card.
