Campus Bus GPS Tracker

A smart tracking system that provides real-time bus location visibility for students and staff via a web dashboard, using ESP32, GPS module, and IoT integration.

✅ Problem Statement

Students and staff often wait without knowing the exact location of campus buses, leading to wasted time and frustration. The lack of real-time visibility on bus positions reduces convenience and efficiency on campus.

✅ Proposed Solution

This project solves the problem by providing:

Real-time bus location tracking using ESP32 and GPS.

Cloud-based data storage (API/Firebase) for accessibility.

A web dashboard to display the current bus position on a map.

Future features such as ETA predictions, notifications, and AI-based optimizations.
